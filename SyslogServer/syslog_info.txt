RFC 5425 - TLS for Syslog is not supported yet


RFC 6587 Transmission of Syslog Messages over TCP
RFC 5426 Transmission of Syslog Messages over UDP
RFC 5424 The Syslog Protocol - Obsoletes: RFC 3164  
RFC 3164 - The BSD syslog Protocol - Obsoleted by RFC 5424
YOU SHOULD NO LONGER FOLLOW RFC 3164 except for legacy reasons (i.e. backwards compatibility).







RFC5424 removed the requirement of using only UDP for log sending, 
but still mandates UDP be supported (for at least backwards compatibility).

One option available starting with RFC 5424 is TCP.

To guarantee message delivery, right? 
WRONG! TCP DOES NOT GUARANTEE MESSAGE DELIVERY. 
VERY IMPORTANT: Message receipt acknowledgment (i.e. TCP handshake) != guaranteed message delivery

But one knows that the server is up and running 
UDP doesn't give an error ! 



receivedData = Encoding.ASCII.GetString(receivedBytes, 0, receivedBytes.Length);
